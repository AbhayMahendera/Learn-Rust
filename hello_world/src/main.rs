fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}


// fn main() {} defines main function. This is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
// If there were any parameters , they would go inside the parentheses ().
// println! calls a macro .
// if it were to be a function , it would be entered as println ( without the !)
