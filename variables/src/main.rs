// you need to add mut to let the compiler know that this value is mutable.
// it also helps the readers to know that you will be changing the value somewhere in the future.


// variable vs constants
// constants are alway immutable
// can only be set to a constant expression and not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.


// naming conventions - constants follow snake case but all of them to be upper case.

// re-declaring a variable with the keyword 'let' makes the second variable overshadow the first variable.
// the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.


// mut keyword dont let us change the type. to explain :

/*
let mut x = 6;
x = "six";

This will give an error.
*/

// shadowing helps us do this 

/*
    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();

//             <--------- DATA TYPES --------->

// Rust is statically typed. It must know types of all variables at compile time.


/*


- Integers :

Length  |   Signed  |   Unsigned
--------|-----------|------------
8-Bit   |   i8      |   u8
16      |   i16     |   u16
32      |   i32     |   u32
64      |   i64     |   u64
128     |   i128    |   u128
arch    |   isize   |   usize

Signed numbers are stored using two's complement representation.

Each signed variant can store numbers from :
    -(2^(n-1)) to (2^(n-1)) -1

    n is the number of bits that variant uses.

ex : i8 can store numbers from -2^7 to 2^7 -1 => -128 to 127

Each Unsigned Variant can store values from 0 to 2^(n-1) -1


Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as ‚Äúarch‚Äù: 64 bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.


Integer Overflow :
1. When compiling in debug mode , Rust includes check for integer overflow that cause your program to * panic * at run time.
2. When compiling in release mode , Rust perform's two's compliment wrapping.

}

// The tuple without any values has a special name, unit. This value and its corresponding type are both written () and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don‚Äôt return any other value.
